{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/project-images/in-place-annotation.jpg" caption='Shared annotations using pico-projectors allows us to do a lot of neat things: (a) viewing an annotation; (b) adding an annotation through the tablet; (c) seeing both annotations associated with the object, and (d) viewing the annotations with others.' %}

Advances in consumer-grade technology will soon make augmented reality an everyday reality, where devices track an understand their position and orientation in physical space, and correspondingly update digital information (frequently as overlays) atop this tracking. We are exploring ways of leveraging these affordances for fun and engaging shared experiences. We designed a way to annotate physical space using a pico-projector combined with a tablet device {% cite tang2013annotation %}, and designed a toolkit to prototype these interactions kinds of projector-based interactions {% cite weigel2013projectorkit %}. We have also examined how such interactions could be used for exploring health data {% cite seyed2014medical %}, and for remote physiotherapy {% cite dillman2013remotephysiotherapy %}.
