RICELab (Rethinking Interaction, Collaboration and Engagement) designs, builds, and studies novel systems for communication and collaboration. We are comprised of faculty, students and researchers interested in studying problems in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work, and Ubiquitous Computing. 

Our work focuses on the design, implementation and evaluation of novel interactive technologies in a variety of contexts, and involves primarily three major types of activities: the investigation of domain-specific communication and interaction problems that have implications for new (or existing) technology; the implementation of new technologies to address needs in those domain-specific contexts, and user evaluation of interactive technologies. These major activities cut across three theme areas:

* **Digital workrooms.** New technologies for collaborative activities for next generation meeting rooms, which will be comprised of large-scale interactive surfaces (walls and tables), and personal devices (tablets, mobile phones, etc.).
* **Health and wellness.** As new media technologies become increasingly pervasive, there is a huge opportunity to leverage the design thinking in domestic and personal wellness applications.
* **Mobile computing.** Mobile devices allow us to leverage aspects of personal context (e.g. physical location, personal activity, etc.) that can be used for the purpose of designâ€”both for input (sensing) and output (contextually relevant). 

We are a sub-lab of the larger [Interactions Lab](http://ilab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca) group, where we are collocated with several other groups interested in HCI, InfoVis, HRI and Design. We are all part of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/) in the [University of Calgary](http://www.ucalgary.ca/) located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
